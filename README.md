# Menu-driven-linked-list-operations
Developed a menu driven program to perform insert and delete operations in an important data structure named linked list. Introduced insert and delete operations on specific position as declared by the user. Covered all edge cases like deleting nodes from an empty linked list, inserting elements in a position greater than number of nodes and soon.

1. Used the concept of modularization to avoid redundant repetitive code.
2. Self explainatory code with proper use of comments.
3. Clean code with proper sequence and descriptive names of functions and variables.
4. Tested multiple times on different inputs to avoid any error due to edge cases.
5. Divided the code into several blocks to identify errors and debug them easily.
// Used NULL pointer to avoid dangling pointers (pointers with unassigned address variables) and avoided generating errors during program execution.
